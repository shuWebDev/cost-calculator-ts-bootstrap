            Please Note: The estimates above apply to full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students only. This estimate is based on an expected family contribution (EFC) of <strong>${results.EFC}</strong>. Your actual EFC will be determined each year by filing the FAFSA.<br />
            These estimates do not represent a final determination, or actual award, of financial assistance or a final net price; they are only estimates based on price of attendance and financial aid provided to students in 2019-2020. Price of attendance and financial aid availability change year to year. These estimates shall not be binding on the Secretary of Education, the institution of higher education, or the State. <br />
            Not all students receive financial aid. In 2019-2020, 92% of our full-time students enrolling for college for the first time received grant/scholarship aid. Students may also be eligible for student loans and work-study. Students must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) in order to determine their eligibility for Federal financial aid that includes Federal grant, loan, or work-study assistance. For more information on applying for Federal student aid, go to <a aria-label="FAFSA" href="http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/">http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/</a>
